# INTERFACE

Interface can be used to reduce redundant use of identical functions

1. Interfaces are not generic types
2. Interfaces are implicit(implied), our custom type (struct) either satisfies the interface or it doesn't
3. Interfaces are a type of "contract" to help your code structure and type correctly, but the return values are not ensured. Interface !== tests

Aside: Start from reading and understanding interfaces because they take time to get used to
